# Guess Game

The first hands-on Rust project with a classic programming problem: The Guessing Game. Focusing on learning the simple pattern matching with Rust.

## How it works?

It will generate random number between 1 and 100. It will prompt to input a guess number. Then the program will indicate whether the guess was `too low` or `too high` along with the guess attempts left. If the guess is correct or it ran out of the attempts, the game will over.

## Run

Run the `cargo run` command to start the game.
